#Print out a long string for the story
print(f"""{name1} and {name2} were in {emotion}.
However, {name1} wanted {thing1}, which {name3} had.
Since there's no such thing as {emotion}, {name1} left {name2} for {name3} and, more importantly, {thing1}.
Now {name1} {emotion}s {name3}, or something.
However, life isn't all cruel, and even though {name1} might be in {place1} working at a random {work1}...
{name1} will always have themselves.
As life is a {thing2}, and from what I know about {thing2}s, they never end with the bad.
A {thing3} is a {thing4}, because as easily as one can leave, another can take its place.
So, {name1} moves on over time, {name3} learns better over time, and everyone moves on.""")
